# Overview

This PRD defines comprehensive review and validation requirements for the Snowflake SPCS to on-premise database connectivity documentation, specifically validating that it meets the needs of junior engineers (0-2 years cloud experience) with limited AWS, Azure, and Snowflake background. The review must validate technical accuracy against official sources, verify template functionality through deployment testing, ensure documentation completeness, AND confirm that explanations, terminology definitions, and learning support are appropriate for junior engineers.

## Review Scope

The review covers:

# Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Chapter Reviews (Tasks 1A-6A)
Review main documentation chapters sequentially to establish baseline accuracy and identify structural issues before template validation.

## Phase 2: Template Functional Validation (Tasks 7A-7D)
Deploy and test all templates to ensure functionality matches documentation. This phase requires sandbox AWS and Azure environments.

## Phase 3: Supporting Documentation (Tasks 8A-8C)
Review README files and supporting documentation to ensure navigation and overview content is accurate.

## Phase 4: Best Practices Audit (Tasks 9B-9D)
Comprehensive review of architecture, cost, and operational practices to ensure quality.

## Phase 5: Remediation and Retesting
Address all findings from previous phases and retest to confirm corrections.

# Logical Dependency Chain

## Review must proceed in this order:

1. **Chapter Reviews First**: Validate content accuracy before testing implementation
2. **Templates After Chapters**: Template review depends on chapter accuracy
3. **Supporting Docs Follow**: Navigation documentation reviewed after content is stable
4. **Best Practices Last**: Holistic review after all components validated

## Parallel Work Opportunities

These reviews can proceed in parallel:
- AWS chapters and templates (3A, 3B, 3C, 7A, 7B)
- Azure chapters and templates (4A, 4B, 4C, 7C, 7D)
- Supporting documentation reviews (8A, 8B, 8C)

## Blocking Dependencies

- Template validation (7A-7D) requires sandbox environments provisioned
- Best practices review (9B-9D) requires all documentation finalized
- Supporting docs review (8A-8C) requires main chapters stable

# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges

**Risk**: Cloud provider UI changes make screenshot validation impossible
**Mitigation**: Focus on functional validation over UI matching, note review date clearly

**Risk**: Template deployment testing is expensive
**Mitigation**: Use sandbox accounts with spending limits, destroy resources immediately after validation

**Risk**: Snowflake environment access required for SPCS testing
**Mitigation**: Focus on SQL syntax validation, defer end-to-end testing to integration phase

**Risk**: On-premise connectivity required for complete validation
**Mitigation**: Validate logic and configuration, note that final connectivity depends on customer environment

## Resource Constraints

**Time**: Full review and testing requires significant time investment
**Solution**: Prioritize critical paths (Chapter 3/4, Template 7A/7B for production deployment)

**Environment Access**: Requires both AWS and Azure sandbox accounts
**Solution**: Create dedicated test accounts with appropriate cost controls

**Expertise**: Requires knowledge across AWS, Azure, Snowflake, and Terraform
**Solution**: Use official documentation heavily, focus on verification over interpretation
